# Toy-NextJS-BloggingTool(v1)

The main goal of the `Toy-NextJS-BloggingTool` project is to learn how Next.js works, especially how SSR, Static generation, client-side rendering work all together in this framework. I was inspired a lot by [Velog project](https://github.com/velopert/velog).

- visit [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) to find more about this framework.
